## GUI
- a GUI is underway, but is not yet complete

## puzzle generation
- the current algorithm for generating a puzzle is very basic
- do not expect quality crossword puzzles
- as of right now, all built-in clues are simply definitions

### Words & Solutions
- words shipped with crossyword come from [this pdf](https://corporate.lowes.com/sites/lowes-corp/files/2020-01/manhattan_prep_1000_gre_words_.pdf)

### Using your own words
- crossyword does not yet support custom files, but you can edit `words.txt` to add your own words
- Place each new word on a new line, and seperate the word and clue with a period (.)
- For example: `alumina.Aluminium oxide`
